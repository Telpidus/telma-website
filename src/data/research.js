    subtitle: "PostDoc @ Rosenblum Lab, UCBerkeley ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ",
    description:
      "I studied phenotypic convergence across species and habitats and divergence within species to investigate the genomic basis of Lizard's adaptation to rapid environmental change: does natural selection use the same tools to produce similar, and diverging, cryptic coloration phenotypes? What are the idiosyncrasies of convergent evolution? What genes underlie fast adaptive change?",

      "I focused on European three spined stickleback fish to research the tempo and mode of natural selection: what footprints does this force leave on the genome? Can we capture selection acting in real time? What genes are shaped by selection and underlie phenotypic adaptations?",

    description:
      "I combined environmental, phenotypic and genomic data to research the level of divergence between two parapatric subspecies of Timon lepidus (ocellated lizard) living along a climatic cline: Are these subspecies far in the path of the speciation continuum? Is dorsal coloration an expression of local adaptation? How much is divergence shaped by demography?",
