        I’m a scientist, communicator and educator.
    
        As evolutionary biologist, I study how species evolve and adapt to
        environmental change, as writter and educator I focus on systemic 
        socio-ecological issues and how they shape our relationship with each other and nature.

          I was born and raised in Portugal, and my research in evolution & genomics 
          took me across 5 continents, where I learned biodiversity from different 
          species and within different communities. 
          Reptiles hold a special wonder-full place in my heart!

        <b>
          In 2019, I founded evALLution: an education project to make evolution
          and biodiversity accessible for, and with, people with blindness. This woke up a love for multisensory education, 
          and ideas of biodiversity knowledge as path towards belonging.

        I’m a first-generation high school graduate, and believe that a more
        inclusive and holistic education system is key for a sustainable and
        equitable future.

          Currently, I'm working on designing culturaly-responsive
          education resources that foster complex systemic thinking and kindle a 
          true sense of shared ancestry with and belonging to all life on Earth.
