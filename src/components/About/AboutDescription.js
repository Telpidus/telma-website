        I’m scientist, communicator and educator.
        As an evolutionary biologist, I study how species evolve and adapt to
        environmental change, as a writter and educator I focus on systemic 
        socio-ecological issues and how they shape our relationship with nature!

          I was born and raised in Portugal, and my research on population genomics 
          travelled me across 5 continents, where I learned biodiversity from different 
          species and within different communities. 
          Reptiles hold a special wonder-full place in my heart!

          In 2019, I founded evALLution: an education project to make evolution
          and biodiversity accessible for, and with, people with blindness.

        I’m a first-generation high school graduate, and believe that a more
        inclusive and holistic education system is key for a sustainable and
        equitable future.

          Currently, I'm working on designing multisensory and culturaly-responsive
          education resources that foster complex systemic thinkig and kindle a 
          true sense of shared ancestry with and belonging to life on Earth.
